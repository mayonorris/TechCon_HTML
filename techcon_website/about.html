        Launched in 2010, TechCon began as a small meetup for local developers and
        engineers. Over the years, it has grown into a global technology conference
        that welcomes thousands of participants from around the world.

        From its first edition in a single auditorium to today’s multi-track,
        multi-day experience, TechCon has consistently showcased cutting-edge
        innovations and emerging trends in software, hardware, and digital products.
